# ALKANES-RS Progress

## What Works

Based on the project documentation and structure, the following components appear to be implemented and functional:

1. **Core Protocol Implementation**:
   - ALKANES metaprotocol as a subprotocol of runes
   - Integration with the METASHREW indexer stack
   - Block processing and transaction validation
   - Message extraction and handling

2. **Runtime Environment**:
   - WebAssembly-based execution environment
   - Fuel metering system for computation
   - Context management for contract execution
   - Storage abstraction for state management

3. **Standard Library Contracts**:
   - Authentication token implementation
   - Owned token contracts
   - Genesis contracts for different networks
   - Proxy contracts for upgradeable functionality
   - Merkle distributor for token distribution

4. **View Functions**:
   - Query interface for the ALKANES state
   - RPC methods for external access
   - Simulation capabilities for transactions

5. **Cross-Network Support**:
   - Support for multiple Bitcoin-based networks
   - Network-specific parameters and genesis configurations
   - Feature flags for different network targets

## What's Left to Build

The following areas appear to be targets for continued development:

1. **Enhanced Standard Library**:
   - Additional DeFi primitives
   - More sophisticated financial instruments
   - Advanced governance mechanisms

2. **Developer Tooling**:
   - Improved contract development workflow
   - Better testing frameworks
   - Deployment and monitoring tools

3. **Documentation and Examples**:
   - Comprehensive developer documentation
   - Example applications and use cases
   - Tutorials and guides

4. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - More efficient state management
   - Reduced computational overhead
   - Optimized storage access patterns

5. **Cross-Protocol Interoperability**:
   - Better integration with other Bitcoin layer 2 solutions
   - Bridges to other blockchain ecosystems
   - Standardized interfaces for interoperability

## Current Status

The project appears to be in active development with a functional core implementation. The current status can be summarized as:

1. **Core Protocol**: Implemented and functional
2. **Runtime Environment**: Implemented and functional
3. **Standard Library**: Partially implemented with key contracts available
4. **Cross-Network Support**: Implemented for multiple networks
5. **Developer Tooling**: Basic functionality available, room for improvement
6. **Documentation**: Initial documentation available, needs expansion
7. **Testing Infrastructure**: Basic testing framework in place

The project has established a solid foundation with the core protocol and runtime environment, and is now expanding its capabilities through additional standard library contracts and improved tooling.

## Known Issues

Based on the documentation, the following issues or limitations have been identified:

1. **Table Relationship Management**:
   - Double indexing can lead to inconsistent state
   - Careful management of table relationships is required
   - Testing must ensure proper table population

2. **WebAssembly Limitations**:
   - Limited memory model
   - No direct system access
   - Limited floating-point precision

3. **Bitcoin Compatibility Constraints**:
   - Limited transaction size
   - Limited script capabilities
   - No native smart contract support

4. **Indexer Performance**:
   - Handling large blocks and transactions
   - Maintaining state consistency
   - Scaling with blockchain growth

5. **Cross-Network Differences**:
   - Different address formats
   - Different block structures
   - Different activation heights
